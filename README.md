# VS2 Ship assembler

A simple mod meant to provide a better way to assemble VS2 ships.

Currently VS2's relocation util, which is used by most addons for assembly, causes dupe bugs and issues with blocks like redstone. This mod solves that, using a jerry rigged and ported to kotlin architechtury version of [M-Marvin's custom assembly code](https://github.com/M-Marvin/MCMOD-Industria). Hats off to him, because all I did was poorly throw together a mod using it.
